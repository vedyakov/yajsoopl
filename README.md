Yet another js oop library. Library contains two simple classes for inheritance.

* BaseClass – class with recursive calling init functions. Classes is not just methods of prototype. In initialization method of class can be usefull instructions, so we don't want duplicate it in child constructor, so we need recursive calling for parents init functions.
* CommonClass – class with usefull options convention and methods.
